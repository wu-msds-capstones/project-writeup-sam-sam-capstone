    "text": "The rapid advancement of generative AI models has significantly lowered the barrier for creating music, raising concerns about transparency, authenticity, and impacts on human composers. Commercial streaming platforms currently lack reliable methods to differentiate between machine-generated and human-performed tracks, which may negatively affect listener trust and disadvantage musicians.\nFor instance, the widespread popularity of AI-produced albums, such as the recent viral success of The Velvet Sundown in June 2025, demonstrates the increasing prevalence and sophistication of AI-generated music. Although many AI-produced works can be easily identified through visual or contextual clues, automated detection based solely on audio remains challenging, particularly when controlling for confounding factors such as instrumentation, style, and mixing.\nThis study addresses a specific aspect of this broader challenge by investigating whether standard acoustic features can reliably distinguish between human-performed and AI-generated solo piano music. Solo piano excerpts were chosen specifically to control for differences in instrumentation, ensemble size, and production effects, providing a clearer basis for analysis.\nA balanced dataset of 722 piano clips (361 human, 361 AI) was compiled from public-domain performances (FMA, Musopen) and several generative models (AIVA, MuseNet, Udio, and two additional emergent systems). All clips were standardized (44.1 kHz mono WAV at –23 LUFS), and we extracted 55 acoustic descriptors covering spectral, temporal, harmonic, and cepstral domains. Statistical testing and model-based rankings then yielded a subset of ten non-redundant, informative features. Finally, those features were used to train and evaluate a calibrated stacking ensemble classifier via 5-fold cross-validation and a held-out test set (80/20 split)."

    "text": "3.1 Data Acquisition\nData for this project was gathered from multiple sources. The human-composed solo piano music was gathered from two different open source music archives including: Free Music Archive and Musopen. The AI-generated music was manually sourced by utilizing free web-based AI music generators: AIVA, Suno, Udio, Riffusion, and DeepAI.\nTo ensure replicability, AI clips were generated using minimal, piano-only prompts such as “solo piano, only piano” and slight variations (e.g., “solo piano performance”, “classical solo piano”). These were chosen after pilot testing showed they produced the highest proportion of pure piano output without extra instrumentation.\nPieces were included only if they met quality standards: - Instrument purity — no audible non-piano sounds. - Clarity — no distortion, clipping, or excessive background noise. - Adequate dynamic range — clear differences between soft and loud passages. - Sufficient volume — must normalize without introducing artifacts.\nThis was important because spectral and harmonic features can be influenced by recording quality; setting strict criteria reduced the likelihood that observed differences were due to microphone, mixing, or mastering factors rather than performance or composition."

    "text": "3.2 Data Processing\nAfter downloading human and AI-generated solo piano pieces from their respective sources, several preprocessing steps were taken to prepare a consistent and balanced dataset. A Python script was utilized to standardize each audio file to mono 16-bit WAV format at 44.1 kHz sampling rate and normalized loudness to -23 LUFS, eliminating differences related to audio quality and loudness. To ensure sufficient sample size and balanced representation, especially since AI-generated pieces tended to be shorter, we randomly extracted up to four 30-second excerpts from each AI-generated track, and up to two excerpts from each human-performed track. These excerpts were selected by dividing each piece into non-overlapping excerpts and randomly sampling among them.\nFrom each excerpt, we extracted a variety of acoustic features covering four broad categories: - Spectral features capture the overall sound color or timbre of the piano, reflecting characteristics such as brightness and tonal complexity.\n- Temporal features describe rhythmic and timing aspects, such as how consistently or expressively the performer maintains tempo.\n- Harmonic features quantify the musical relationships between notes and chords, providing insights into the structural and tonal qualities of the music.\n- Cepstral features represent subtle variations in sound texture, helping to distinguish nuanced differences in tone and articulation between human and AI performances.\nCollectively, these acoustic features allowed us to systematically characterize the musical differences between human-performed and AI-generated piano excerpts. The resulting data set includes 58 acoustic features from a balanced number of 722 30-second excerpts, 361 of which were AI-generated excerpts and 361 of which were human-composed excerpts."

Every audio excerpt was assigned a unique identifier, linking it consistently across tables and enabling accurate referencing of the original sources and associated features.\nThe full dataset was generated directly by a Python script that extracted 58 acoustic features from each audio clip. This dataset preserved all raw features without alteration, providing a comprehensive view of each excerpt’s acoustic profile.\nLastly, a streamlined final feature dataset was created, containing only the ten features identified as most predictive during feature selection. This reduced dataset served as the primary input for modeling, ensuring clarity, interpretability, and computational efficiency."

Table 1 provides an overview of these features and their definitions.\n\n3.4.1 Table 1. Features used in the final model and their definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Name\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nspectral_bandwidth_mean\nHow wide the sound is, from low to high; higher values often mean a brighter, more complex tone.\n\n\ntempo_std\nHow much the speed of the music varies; lower values mean steadier tempo, while higher values reflect more expressive or inconsistent timing.\n\n\nchroma_stft_mean\nMeasures how often certain musical notes or chords show up; gives a sense of harmonic “color.”\n\n\nonset_rate\nCounts how frequently new notes or sounds begin, like how “busy” or active the playing is.\n\n\nspectral_centroid_mean\nWhere most of the sound energy is focused; higher values sound brighter, lower values sound darker.\n\n\nmfcc_3_mean\nCaptures details of tone and timbre, like a fingerprint of the sound texture.\n\n\nmfcc_5_mean\nAnother layer of tonal detail; helps distinguish between human and machine playing styles.\n\n\ntonnetz_3_mean\nDescribes how chords and tones relate; tracks harmonic movement or tension.\n\n\ntonnetz_6_mean\nAlso captures harmonic relationships, different from tonnetz_3 but similarly focused on musical structure.\n\n\nmfcc_delta2_13_mean\nTracks how the tonal texture changes over time; helps identify expressive or mechanical playing shifts.\n\n\n\nTo identify a concise and informative subset of acoustic features, we employed a approach that combined statistical hypothesis testing and model-based importance rankings.\nFirst, we used several univariate statistical tests — Welch’s t-tests, point-biserial correlations, and one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD — to measure the strength and consistency of differences between human-composed and AI-generated piano excerpts. Welch’s t-test was chosen because it robustly handles unequal variances and unequal sample sizes between groups.\nWhile some features deviated from normality under Shapiro–Wilk tests, Welch’s t-test is robust to moderate non-normality, especially with balanced samples. Point-biserial correlations are reported as descriptive effect sizes rather than formal significance tests. Sensitivity checks with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests produced qualitatively similar results.\nThe point-biserial correlation, shown in Figure Figure 2, quantified the strength of the linear relationship between each feature and the binary outcome (human or AI). The ANOVA (with Tukey post-hoc tests) confirmed statistically significant differences between group means while adjusting for multiple comparisons. Figure Figure 1 displays the standardized mean differences of the final features that were selected, and whether or not the means are higher in the AI or human-composed classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1: Standardized mean differences (z-score) between human and AI excerpts for the ten selected features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 2: Point-biserial correlations between each selected acoustic feature and the binary class label.\n\n\n\nNext, we compared feature rankings from three complementary methods, as shown in Figure Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure 3: Top ten acoustic descriptors selected from the full set of 58 features, ranked by three complementary methods.\n\n\n\nThree variables emerged as especially influential in distinguishing AI-generated from human performances:\n- Spectral bandwidth …\n- Tempo variability …\n- Chroma balance …\nA Chi-square test found no significant association between feature distribution and generation platform (p &gt; 0.05), suggesting that differences are not platform-specific."

We ultimately settled on a stacking model combining calibrated logistic regression, random forest (100 trees, max_depth = 5), gradient boosting, and naïve Bayes base learners. Pairwise interaction terms were added via second-degree polynomial features, and a logistic regression meta-learner was used to integrate their outputs. Stratified five-fold cross-validation guided hyperparameter selection and helped limit overfitting, while a final hold-out evaluation provided an unbiased assessment."
