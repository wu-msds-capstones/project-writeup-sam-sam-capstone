    "text": "The rapid advancement of generative AI models has significantly lowered the barrier for creating music, raising concerns about transparency, authenticity, and impacts on human composers. Commercial streaming platforms currently lack reliable methods to differentiate between machine-generated and human-performed tracks, which may negatively affect listener trust and disadvantage musicians. For instance, the widespread popularity of AI-produced albums, such as the recent viral success of The Velvet Sundown in June 2025, demonstrates the increasing prevalence and sophistication of AI-generated music. Although many AI-produced works can be easily identified through visual or contextual clues, automated detection based solely on audio remains challenging, particularly when controlling for confounding factors such as instrumentation, style, and mixing. This study addresses a specific aspect of this broader challenge by investigating whether standard acoustic features can reliably distinguish between human-performed and AI-generated solo piano music. Solo piano excerpts were chosen specifically to control for differences in instrumentation, ensemble size, and production effects, providing a clearer basis for analysis. A balanced dataset of 722 piano clips (361 human, 361 AI) was compiled from public-domain performances (FMA, Musopen) and several generative models (AIVA, MuseNet, Udio, and two additional emergent systems). All clips were standardized (44.1 kHz mono WAV at –23 LUFS), and we extracted 55 acoustic descriptors covering spectral, temporal, harmonic, and cepstral domains. Statistical testing and model-based rankings then yielded a subset of ten non-redundant, informative features. Finally those features were used to train and evaluate a calibrated stacking ensemble classifier via 5-fold cross-validation and a held-out test set (80/20 split)."

    "text": "3.1 Data Acquisition\nData for this project was gathered from multiple sources. The human-composed solo piano music was gathered from two different open source music archives including: Free Music Archive and Musopen. The AI-generated music was manually sourced by utilizing free web-based AI music generators: AIVA, Suno, Udio, Riffusion, and DeepAI.\nTo ensure replicability, AI clips were generated using minimal, piano-only prompts such as “solo piano, only piano” and slight variations (e.g., “solo piano performance”, “classical solo piano”). These were chosen after pilot testing showed they produced the highest proportion of pure piano output without extra instrumentation.\nPieces were included only if they met quality standards: - Instrument purity — no audible non-piano sounds. - Clarity — no distortion, clipping, or excessive background noise. - Adequate dynamic range — clear differences between soft and loud passages. - Sufficient volume — must normalize without introducing artifacts.\nThis was important because spectral and harmonic features can be influenced by recording quality; setting strict criteria reduced the likelihood that observed differences were due to microphone, mixing, or mastering factors rather than performance or composition."

    "text": "3.2 Data Processing\nAfter downloading human and AI-generated solo piano pieces from their respective sources, several preprocessing steps were taken to prepare a consistent and balanced dataset. A Python script was utilized to standardize each audio file to mono 16-bit WAV format at 44.1 kHz sampling rate and normalized loudness to -23 LUFS, eliminating differences related to audio quality and loudness. To ensure sufficient sample size and balanced representation, especially since AI-generated pieces tended to be shorter, we randomly extracted up to four 30-second excerpts from each AI-generated track, and up to two excerpts from each human-performed track. These excerpts were selected by dividing each piece into non-overlapping excerpts and randomly sampling among them.\nFrom each excerpt, we extracted a variety of acoustic features covering four broad categories: - Spectral features capture the overall sound color or timbre of the piano, reflecting characteristics such as brightness and tonal complexity.\n- Temporal features describe rhythmic and timing aspects, such as how consistently or expressively the performer maintains tempo.\n- Harmonic features quantify the musical relationships between notes and chords, providing insights into the structural and tonal qualities of the music.\n- Cepstral features represent subtle variations in sound texture, helping to distinguish nuanced differences in tone and articulation between human and AI performances.\nCollectively, these acoustic features allowed us to systematically characterize the musical differences between human-performed and AI-generated piano excerpts. The resulting data set includes 58 acoustic features from a balanced number of 722 30-second excerpts, 361 of which were AI-generated excerpts and 361 of which were human-composed excerpts."

Welch’s t-test was chosen because it robustly handles unequal variances and unequal sample sizes between groups.\nWhile some features deviated from normality under Shapiro–Wilk tests, Welch’s t-test is robust to moderate non-normality, especially with balanced samples. Point-biserial correlations are reported as descriptive effect sizes rather than formal significance tests. Sensitivity checks with nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests produced qualitatively similar results.\nThe point-biserial correlation, shown in Figure Figure 2, quantified the strength of the linear relationship between each feature and the binary outcome (human or AI). The ANOVA (with Tukey post-hoc tests) confirmed statistically significant differences between group means while adjusting for multiple comparisons. Figure Figure 1 displays the standardized mean differences of the final features that were selected, and whether or not the means are higher in the AI or human-composed classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 1: Standardized mean differences (z-score) between human and AI excerpts for the ten selected features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 2: Point-biserial correlations between each selected acoustic feature and the binary class label.\n\n\n\nNext, we compared feature rankings from three complementary methods, as shown in Figure Figure 3. On the left, Cohen’s d quantifies each feature’s standardized effect size between human and AI clips, providing a model-agnostic measure of group differences. In the center, the absolute coefficients from an L1-penalized logistic regression pick out features with the strongest linear contributions to classification, enforcing sparsity to highlight only the most robust predictors. On the right, Random Forest Gini importance captures non-linear effects and interactions by measuring how much each feature reduces impurity across the ensemble’s decision trees. Including Cohen’s d alongside these model-based scores ensures we retain features that exhibit large, consistent differences in the raw data, even before any model fitting. Features were prioritized based on how consistently they ranked in the top 10 across multiple methods. However, it was important to keep in mind feature redundancy which we discuss in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure 3: Top ten acoustic descriptors selected from the full set of 58 features, ranked by three complementary methods.\n\n\n\nThree variables emerged as especially influential in distinguishing AI-generated from human performances. Spectral bandwidth, which reflects the range of frequencies present, tended to be narrower in human recordings, with a richer midrange produced by natural pedaling and touch. In contrast, AI clips often showed unnaturally extended highs and lows resulting from synthesis. Tempo variability captured natural fluctuations in timing, human performers frequently speed up or slow down for expressive effect, whereas AI outputs were more metronomic. Chroma balance, a measure of the evenness of pitch-class use, also differed between the two groups: human players often favored certain tonal centers or voicings, while AI tended toward a more uniform distribution across keys and harmonies.\nA Chi-square test found no significant association between feature distribution and generation platform (p &gt; 0.05), suggesting that differences are not platform-specific."

A few human excerpts kept an unusually steady tempo or had a balanced mix of notes, making them sound more like AI pieces. Overall, the stacking model was good at telling human and AI piano apart, but certain playing styles made the line between them less clear.\nPlatform effects. A chi-square test found no significant association between platform and label prevalence (p &gt; 0.05), but Suno clips showed visually tight clusters and contributed many extremes in spectral bandwidth and onset rate in the outlier screen. This suggests stylistic/production tendencies can influence where clips appear in feature space even when label balance across platforms is not biased."

Shapiro–Wilk tests indicated that all features deviated from normality in at least one group (p &lt; 0.05), so we did not assume normally distributed data. We also ran Levene’s tests for homogeneity of variances, which showed that several key features — such as spectral_bandwidth_mean, tempo_std, and mfcc_3_mean — had significantly different variances between classes. These results reinforced our choice of Welch’s t-test, which is robust to both non-normality and unequal variances, for all hypothesis testing.\nFor the logistic regression model, we examined variance inflation factors (VIF) to assess multicollinearity among the ten final features. All VIF values were below the commonly used threshold of 5, indicating no problematic collinearity. This confirmed that each feature contributed unique information to the model and that coefficient estimates would remain stable and interpretable."

AI-generated clips, in contrast, frequently group together in areas characterized by steadier tempi and broader spectral energy. Notably, outlier analysis revealed that most extreme cases in the AI class came from the Suno platform, which tended to produce pieces with unusually high spectral bandwidth and onset rates. These characteristics explain much of the tight clustering for Suno-generated excerpts, while other AI platforms showed more dispersion. Occasional overlaps between classes appear to stem from individual pieces whose acoustic profiles happen to align, rather than random noise, reinforcing the need for a supervised model to capture subtle but consistent distinctions across platforms."

    "text": "5.6 Discussion\nIn this work, we developed a transparent, feature-based pipeline to distinguish 30-second solo piano excerpts as human-composed or AI-generated. By starting with a balanced dataset of 722 excerpts and extracting 55 acoustic descriptors, we used statistical tests and model-based rankings to hone in on a non-redundant set of ten features. Our enhanced stacking ensemble, combining calibrated logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and naïve Bayes with interaction terms, achieved 82.1 % accuracy (0.924 ROC-AUC) on held-out data. While these results are encouraging, our primary goal is to illuminate which acoustic cues reliably signal “humanness” in piano performance.\n\n5.6.1 Acoustic Cues of “Humanness”\nThree main features stood out as the most useful for telling human and AI piano apart. Spectral bandwidth measures how sound energy is spread across low and high pitches. Human pianists often create a balance between brightness and warmth, while AI pieces sometimes sound either too bright or too flat. Tempo variability tracks how much the speed changes during a performance. Human players naturally slow down or speed up slightly for expression, while AI pieces tend to keep a steady beat. Chroma balance looks at how evenly different notes and chords are used. Humans often vary chord shapes and emphasize certain tones in a way that feels more natural and emotional, while AI outputs can sound more uniform. Together, these features capture differences in tone, rhythm, and harmony that often make human performances feel more expressive.\n\n\n5.6.2 Error Modes and Model Boundaries\nWe found two main ways the model made mistakes. Some AI pieces, even though they were computer-generated, had a loose, human-like timing pattern (similar to rubato) but also very bright, wide-ranging tones. These fooled the model into thinking they were human, which suggests the model sometimes focuses more on timing than tone. On the other hand, some human performances were so steady in tempo and so average in harmonic balance that they came across as mechanical, leading the model to label them as AI. In short, very “human-like” AI playing and very “machine-like” human playing were the trouble spots. These cases suggest the model might do better if it could also pick up on other cues, like how the sustain pedal is used or finer details of timing changes.\n\n\n5.6.3 Data Ethics\nThis project has several limitations and ethical considerations that should be acknowledged. Our human recordings were drawn from public-domain sources (FMA, Musopen) under clear licensing terms, but these archives do not fully capture the range of piano styles, traditions, or performer backgrounds. As a result, the model may reflect biases if applied to music outside this narrow scope.\nThere is also a risk of misclassification. Incorrectly labeling a human performance as AI-generated could unfairly affect an artist’s reputation, while missing AI-generated content could allow for misuse or misattribution. For this reason, any automated predictions should be treated as preliminary, ideally accompanied by confidence scores and, when possible, reviewed by human listeners.\nPublishing the specific acoustic patterns that distinguish our dataset’s human and AI recordings could enable future AI systems to imitate these patterns more effectively, reducing the effectiveness of static detectors. Detection tools will likely need ongoing updates, external review, and collaborative oversight to remain reliable.\nFinally, some commercial AI music platforms, including Suno and AIVA, have been criticized for producing works that closely resemble human artists’ styles. If these systems are trained on copyrighted material, their outputs could raise questions around intellectual property and fair use.\n\n\n5.6.4 Directions for Future Work\nTo broaden applicability, future studies should incorporate MIDI/symbolic data for note-level analysis (voice-leading, chord progressions) alongside audio features. Enhancing temporal modeling with metrics like onset-interval autocorrelation or beat-synchronous energy flows could improve sensitivity to expressive phrasing. Hybrid approaches that integrate interpretable features with lightweight neural embeddings (e.g., timbral autoencoders) may capture subtler spectral artifacts. Finally, evaluating the pipeline on unseen AI systems and “in-the-wild” streaming data, using nested cross-validation to guard against overfitting, will be critical for real-world deployment.\nBy clearly identifying which acoustic characteristics drive classification and acknowledging both technical and ethical challenges, we offer a replicable foundation for ongoing work in automated AI-music detection, helping to support listener trust and fair recognition of human artistry."
