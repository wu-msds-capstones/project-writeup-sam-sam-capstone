# Data Engineering

We organized our dataset into three clearly defined tables, each stored separately to facilitate straightforward analysis without unnecessary merging.
A metadata table was created to ensure traceability and reproducibility. Every audio excerpt was assigned a unique identifier, linking it consistently across tables and enabling accurate referencing of the original sources and associated features. 

The full dataset was generated directly by a Python script that extracted 58 acoustic features from each audio clip. This dataset preserved all raw features without alteration, providing a comprehensive view of each excerptâ€™s acoustic profile.

Lastly, a streamlined final feature dataset was created, containing only the ten features identified as most predictive during feature selection. This reduced dataset served as the primary input for modeling, ensuring clarity, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
