  Distinguishing AI-generated from human-performed music is challenging due to differences in instrumentation, style, and production techniques. To minimize these confounding factors, we focused exclusively on 30-second solo piano excerpts, assembling a balanced dataset of 722 clips (361 human, 361 AI). After extracting acoustic descriptors related to spectral content, rhythm, harmony, and timbre, we identified ten highly predictive features through statistical testing and model-based selection. We trained an enhanced stacking ensemble classifier combining logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and naïve Bayes methods. On an unseen hold-out set, the stacking model achieved an accuracy of 82.1% (ROC-AUC 0.924). The strongest predictors included spectral bandwidth, tempo variability, and chroma balance, highlighting clear acoustic signatures associated with human musical performance. These findings offer a transparent and scalable foundation for automated detection of AI-generated music .
