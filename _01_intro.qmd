## Introduction

The rapid advancement of generative AI models has significantly lowered the barrier for creating music, raising concerns about transparency, authenticity, and impacts on human composers. Commercial streaming platforms currently lack reliable methods to differentiate between machine-generated and human-performed tracks, which may negatively affect listener trust and disadvantage musicians  .

For instance, the widespread popularity of AI-produced albums, such as the recent viral success of The Velvet Sundown in June 2025, demonstrates the increasing prevalence and sophistication of AI-generated music. Although many AI-produced works can be easily identified through visual or contextual clues, automated detection based solely on audio remains challenging, particularly when controlling for confounding factors such as instrumentation, style, and mixing.

This study addresses a specific aspect of this broader challenge by investigating whether standard acoustic features can reliably distinguish between human-performed and AI-generated solo piano music. Solo piano excerpts were chosen specifically to control for differences in instrumentation, ensemble size, and production effects, providing a clearer basis for analysis.

A balanced dataset of 722 piano clips (361 human, 361 AI) was compiled from public-domain performances (FMA, Musopen) and several generative models (AIVA, MuseNet, Udio, and two additional emergent systems). All clips were standardized (44.1 kHz mono WAV at â€“23 LUFS), and we extracted 55 acoustic descriptors covering spectral, temporal, harmonic, and cepstral domains. Statistical testing and model-based rankings then yielded a subset of ten non-redundant, informative features. Finally those features were used to train and evaluate a calibrated stacking ensemble classifier via 5-fold cross-validation and a held-out test set (80/20 split).
