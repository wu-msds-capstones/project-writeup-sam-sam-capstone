Dataset Summary

The final dataset contained 722 thirty-second solo piano excerpts, evenly split between human-composed (n = 361) and AI-generated (n = 361) excerpts. Human recordings were drawn from public-domain libraries (FMA and Musopen) spanning classical, jazz and contemporary styles. AI-generated examples came from four systems (AIVA, Udio and two emergent models) to capture a range of algorithmic approaches. All source tracks exceeded 30 seconds, and metadata (platform, license, creator or generator name) was recorded for traceability.

Model Choice and Pipeline

Initial experiments with individual classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) revealed trade-offs between interpretability and performance. We ultimately settled on a stacking model combining calibrated logistic regression, random forest (100 trees, max_depth = 5), gradient boosting, and naïve Bayes base learners. Pairwise interaction terms were added via second-degree polynomial features, and a logistic regression meta-learner was used to integrate their outputs. Stratified five-fold cross-validation guided hyperparameter selection and helped limit overfitting, while a final hold-out evaluation provided an unbiased assessment.

Model Evaluation

Table 2 presents the results of the stacking model on the 20% hold-out test set.

Figure 5 shows the results of the classifier.

Report Train Accuracy

The ROC curve for the model is shown in Figure 6, it shows that the area under the curve is 0.924. This means that the model has a 92.4% chance of classifying an excerpt correctly.

Both classes had the same F1 score (0.82), and ROC-AUC was particularly informative as it evaluates ranking performance independently of any threshold.

4. Error Analysis

To explore where the model was less certain, we reviewed the five most extreme misclassifications in each category. Figure 7 shows the instances where the classification resulted in an AI-generated excerpt was incorrectly labeled as a human-composed excerpt, a false positive, and also where the classification resulted in a human-composed excerpt being incorrectly labeled as an AI-generated excerpt, a false negative.

These AI excerpts combined wide spectral bandwidth with sparse timing cues, suggesting the model sometimes weighed rhythm more heavily than timbre.
Some human excerpts showed very steady tempo or average chroma balance, making them more similar to AI-generated clips.

Overall, these results indicate that the stacking approach can distinguish human from AI piano excerpts reasonably well, while also highlighting specific acoustic conditions that blur the model’s decision boundary.
